== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Interaction of architecture components

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete recipe 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete recipe 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `XYZListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

[NOTE]
====
XYZListPanel refers to the 5 different individual components in our application.
The 5 different components are:

* Dashboard
* RecipeBook
* Exercise
* Health
* Diary
====

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `DukeCooksParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete recipe 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete recipe 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Duke Cooks data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* BlackBox refers to the model diagram of the individual components of DukeCooks as shown below

.Structure of Workout Model
image::WorkoutPlannerModelClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
XYZ refers to the 5 different individual components in our application.
The 5 different components are:

* Dashboard
* RecipeBook
* Exercise
* Health
* Diary
====

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the DukeCooks data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Implementation of Commands and Parser
All command variants (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`, `AddExerciseCommand`) extends from `AddCommand`,
instead of the abstract `Command` class.
This applies to other type of commands as well, such as Delete and Edit.

The diagram below shows a simplified class diagram for Commands and Parser

.Structure of Commands and Parser
image::CommandImplementation.png[]

{nbsp} +
The current implementation provides the added benefit of easier scalability. Overall, we only need to account for the
type of command (i.e `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand` etc). It's corresponding variants (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`,
`DeleteExerciseCommand`) can simply further extend from it. However, its implementation is rather complex and it increases the amount of code within the repository. For each
command variant added, a corresponding command variant parser needs to be added as well.

*Alternatives*

Another possible structure would be for all command variants to extend from the abstract `Command` class directly.
Although this implementation is simpler, it can greatly increase the number of switch cases within `DukeCooksParser`.
This could potentially increase the difficulty of debugging as it becomes harder to locate the bugs. Furthermore,
this structure exposes all the different types of commands to `DukeCooksParser`.

*Our Choice*

We chose to follow the structure provided in the figure above. As our application is comprised of many different
components with the same variants of commands (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), this structure is more suitable as it
reduces the amount of switch cases within `DukeCooksParser` and makes testing more manageable.

// tag::dashboard[]
=== Dashboard features
==== Implementation
The functions add/delete/edit/find/list task, are found under the Dashboard. +
The Dashboard in `DukeCooks` serves as a homepage which displays a list of tasks set out
by the user. The tasks are sorted accordingly by earliest date.
Here, a task is represented by a Dashboard object.

The add/delete/edit/find/list mechanism is implemented in `DukeCooks v1.3`. It extends
`DukeCooks` with a function to add/delete/edit/find tasks.

The operations are as followed:

* `DukeCooks v1.3#add()` -- Adds and saves the task into `DukeCooks`.
* `DukeCooks v1.3#delete()` -- Removes the specified task from `DukeCooks`.
* `DukeCooks v1.3k#edit()` -- Edits the specified with a new task name and/or date.
* `DukeCooks v1.3#find()` -- Finds a list of task with a given keyword.
* `DukeCooks v1.3#list()` -- Finds a list of task with a given keyword.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addDashboard()`,
`Model#deleteDashboard()`, `Model#setDashboard()`, `Model#hasDashboard()` and
`Model#getDashboardRecords()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/delete/edit/find/list
mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `DukeCooks v1.3` will
be initialized with the dashboard state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to
that single dashboard state.

Step 2. The user executes `add task tn/bake a cake td/12/12/2019` command to add a new
task into Duke Cooks. The `add` command calls `Model#addDashboard()`, causing the task to
be added into `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls
`UniqueDashboardList#add()` which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this
stage, the list of task is sorted by date. After which, the `add` command also calls
`Model#saveDashboard()`, causing another modified dashboard state to be saved into the
`UniqueDashboardList`.

Step 3. The user executes `delete task 3` command to delete the 3rd task in the
dashboard. The delete command calls `Model#deleteDashboard()` causing the specified task
to be removed from `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls
`UniqueDashboardList#remove()` which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this
stage, the list of task is sorted by date. Also, it calls `Model#saveDashboard()`,
causing the modified state of the dashboard after the `delete task 3` command executes
to be saved in the `UniqueDashboardList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the
newly inserted dashboard state.

Step 4. The user executes `edit task...` command to edit a field in a task. The edit
command calls `Model#setDashboard()` causing the edited task to be updated in
`UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls `UniqueDashboardList#setDashboard()`
which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this stage, the list of task is
sorted by date. Also, it calls `Model#saveDashboard()`, causing the modified state of the
dashboard after the `edit task...` command executes to `UniqueDashboardList`, and the
`currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted dashboard state.

Step 5. The user executes `find task...` command to find a list of task given a keyword.
The find command calls `Model#hasDashboard()`, which searches through the
`UniqueDashboardList` for tasks containing the particular keyword. The `currentStatePointer`
remains at the same location after the step.

Step 6. The user executes `list task` command to view all the tasks found in `UniqueDashboardList`.
The list command calls `Model#getDashboardRecords()`, which returns the `ReadOnlyDashboard` that
returns the `UniqueDashboardList`, iterating over all the task and displaying it on the
homepage. The `currentStatePointer` remains at the same location after the step.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

image::AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[]

*Aspect: How add/delete/edit/find/list executes*

*Alternative 1 (current choice)*

Sort the list whenever add/delete/edit is called.

* Pros: Easy to implement.
* Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time.

*Alternative 2*

Keep an instance of the earliest and latest date. If dates fall
out of range from the two dates, sorting does not happen.

* Pros: Faster runtime.
* Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

*Aspect: Data structure to support the add/delete/edit/find/list commands*

*Alternative 1 (current choice)*

Use `Collections.sort` to sort by date.

* Pros: Easy to implement.
* Cons: Current implementations require a `LocalDate` object to be create for every
`TaskDate` object.

*Alternative 2*

Use `LocalDate` to store dates instead of creating a custom class,
`TaskDate`.

* Pros: Since this is found in the Java API, we do not have to worry about invalid dates
being keyed.
* Cons: As the current `TaskDate` works fine, refactoring the code to `LocalDate` might
take some time.
// end::dashboard[]

=== RecipeBook feature
The current implementation of RecipeBook consists of the following:

* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `name`
* Each `Recipe` contains an Set of `Ingredient`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Calories`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Carbohydrates`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Fats`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Protein`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Recipe` class.

.Recipe Class Diagram
image::RecipeClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of recipe book commands

`Recipe` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddRecipeCommand` - Adds a `Recipe` into `DukeCooks`
* `DeleteRecipeCommand` - Deletes a `Recipe` from `DukeCooks`
* `EditRecipeCommand` - Edits the specified `Recipe`
* `FindRecipeCommand` - Finds all `Recipe` whose `name` contains user-specified keywords

All the above recipe commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddRecipeCommandParser`,
`DeleteRecipeCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`,
`DeleteRecipeCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeleteRecipeCommand`.
The input provided is `delete recipe 1`.

.DeleteRecipeCommand Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

After a successful execution, the recipe with the specified index will be deleted from the recipe book.

The current implementation makes use of an Sets to store the `Ingredient` objects.
This is the easiest way to implement the `Ingredient` component of the recipe as it builds on the existing codebase
of ab3.

*Alternatives*

An alternative would be to use an ArrayList instead of Sets to store `Ingredient` objects. This would make the
implementation of `Ingredient` specific objects easier as they could be referenced through indexing of the ArrayList,
which is more straight forward.

*Our Choice*

We will soon implement ArrayLists instead as the current implementation of `Ingredient` objects using Sets do not allow
for ease of use for the user whenever the user wishes to edit `Ingredient` objects present within a `Recipe`.

=== Workout Planner feature
==== Implementation
{nbsp} +
*Exercise Management*

Every workout comprises of varying number of exercises. Users can use existing exercises or create their own custom
exercises. Every exercise contains the following information:

* `ExerciseName` representing the name of the exercise
* `MusclesTrained` comprising of the primary `MuscleType` as well as an ArrayList of secondary `MuscleType` trained
* `Intensity` or how demanding the exercise is
* A set of `ExerciseDetails` which are optional additional information of the exercise such as `ExerciseWeight`,
`Distance`, `Sets` and `Repetitions`.

The Exercise class is represented by the following class diagram below.

.Exercise Class Diagram
image::ExerciseClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of Exercise Commands

The `Exercise` class is managed by the following commands :

* `AddExerciseCommand` - Adds a new `Exercise` into `WorkoutPlanner`
* `ClearExerciseCommand` - Clears all the `Exercise` objects in `WorkoutPlanner`
* `DeleteExerciseCommand` - Deletes an `Exercise` specified by an `Index` from `WorkoutPlanner`
* `EditExerciseCommand` - Edits the specified `Exercise` with newly specified information
* `FindExerciseByIntensityCommand` - Lists all `Exercise` objects with the `Intensity` specified
* `FindExerciseByMuscleCommand` - Lists all `Exercise` objects which trains the `MuscleType` specified
* 'FindExerciseCommand' - Lists all `Exercise` objects with `ExerciseName` that contains the string specified
* 'ListExercise' - Lists all 'Exercise' objects in `WorkoutPlanner`

All the commands listed above are parsed in `DukeCooksParser`, invoking the respective Command Parsers
(Add, Delete, Edit etc.). The `Exercise` variant of the parser will then be instantiated
(i.e `AddExerciseCommandParser`,`DeleteExerciseCommandParser` etc) to create the actual command objects
(i.e AddDiaryCommand, DeleteDiaryCommand etc). These Command Objects will then execute the necessary steps
to fulfill their functionality.

*Design Considerations*

When coming up with the Exercise class there were various considerations as to what fields should be added. Initially,
we had planned for MuscleType to be an enum given the limited number of muscles in the human body. However, we had
strayed away from this implementation given the complexity of the way the muscles work as well as the numerous names
that one muscle could be called. We instead allowed the user to define the muscles themselves which is better for their
own understanding. We instead utilised enums for the Intensity field since it is only limited High, Medium and Low.

*Alternatives*

When coming up with the optional details field, `ExerciseDetail` we had morphed the tag feature which was stored in a
Set in AddressBook 3. The various details such as weight, distance would then be implementing the `ExerciseDetail`
interface. After careful consideration, we had come to the conclusion that this method of storage is flawed given that
we only intended for at most one instance of each detail and inability to call upon them at O(1) time complexity.

Instead, we designed the `ExerciseDetails` to be a class with 4 Optional fields containing the various details. This
allows for the details to be obtained more efficiently as well as limit them to only a single instance.


=== Health Records feature
The Health Records feature handles the following:

* Keeping track of the health data recorded by the user
* Present the data with visual representation of a trend graph that shows the health progress of the user

*Proposed Implementation*

The commands that are callable by the user are as followed:

.  `view health` - view the specific type of health records
.  `add health` - adds a new record respective to the type of health records
.  `edit health` - edits a existing health record
.  `delete health` - deletes a existing health record

The class diagram below illustrates the structure of a Health Record class.

.HealthRecords Class Diagram
image::HealthRecordsClassDiagram.png[]

Each Health Record object consist of a Type, Timestamp and Value. The current implementation stores 6 key areas:

2. Weight
3. Height
4. Calories
5. Glucose
6. Blood Pressure
7. Menstrual Cycle (for Females)

[NOTE]
The types available are stored in a list named `TYPE_UTIL`. This means that the validity check of `Type` Object will be checked against `TYPE_UTIL` list. If type does not exist, the record will fail to construct.

In future implementations (possibly in v2.0), the `TYPE_UTIL` list will accommodate more record types defined by the user. This means that there will not be a restriction imposed in health types that can be recorded. User can create a new health type to start health tracking (eg. Sodium level).

===== `add health` Command
`add health t/[type] [inputs]` is parsed in the `addHealthCommandParser`. The inputs will first be initialised to its respective objects with underlying validation checks (eg. `Type` object will call for `isValidType()` method to check against `TYPE_UTIL` List). A `Record` object will then be created with the three valid object components.

The sequence diagram below illustrates a sample run of program where `add health` command has been successfully parsed.

.Sequence Diagram for `add health` command
image::AddHealthSequenceDiagram.png[]


==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: Data structure on how the different health types are stored*

*Alternative 1 (Current Choice)*

Maintain a Map to validate type of health record

A `HashMap` is used to store the different health types and its respective metric unit (eg. Weight, kg). When a health related command is called, the `TYPE_UTIL` will be accessed and checked against to determine if command is valid.

* Pros: Greater flexibility in the implementation and usage of `TYPE_UTIL` Map. Allow possible extension of having more user defined health types.
* Cons: Difficult to keep track of each health type and lack of clarity.


*Alternative 2*

Introduce each health type as a Class on its own

* Pros: Clearer distinction and declaration of each health type
* Cons: Limited to a specific number of health types. User cannot introduce their own health type for record tracking. Requires diligence on developer’s end to introduce new classes for more variations.



=== Diary feature
==== Implementation
The current implementation of Diary consists of the following:

* Each `Diary` consists of a unique `DiaryName`
* Each `Diary` contains an array list of `Page`
* Each `Page` is identified by a unique `Title`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Diary` class.

.Diary Class Diagram
image::DiaryClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of diary commands

`Diary` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddDiaryCommand` - Adds a `Diary` into `DukeCooks`
* `DeleteDiaryCommand` - Deletes a `Diary` from `DukeCooks`
* `EditDiaryCommand` - Edits the specified `Diary` with a new `DiaryName`
* `AddPageCommand` - Adds a new `Page` to the specified `Diary`
* `DeletePageCommand` - Deletes the `Page` in the specified `Diary`

All the above diary commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddDiaryCommandParser`,
`DeleteDiaryCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddDiaryCommand`,
`DeleteDiaryCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeletePageCommand`.

.Sequence Diagram of DeletePageCommand
image::DeletePageSequenceDiagram.png[]

{nbsp} +
After a successful execution, the specified page will be removed from the specified diary.

The current implementation makes use of an ArrayList to store the `Page` objects.
This is the simplest implementation as most novice programmers would be familiar with ArrayLists.
However, list operations tend to take more time to run compared to other data structures such as Sets.

*Alternatives*

An alternative to using ArrayList would be to use sets to store `Page` objects. This could increase the
overall performance of the program as set operations tend to be faster than list operations. However, using sets
does not provide an order to `Page` objects, unlike in lists.

*Our Choice*

We chose to use ArrayLists instead as we require the `Page` objects to be ordered, so that the implementation of
`DeletePageCommand` is simplified. An index can be provided in `DeletePageCommand` and the corresponding `Page`
object can simply be removed from the ArrayList, using the specified index.



=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
