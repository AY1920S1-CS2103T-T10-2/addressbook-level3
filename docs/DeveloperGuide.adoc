== Introduction

DukeCooks is a revolutionary lifestyle application, specially designed for health-conscious individuals. DukeCooks
runs on the Command-Line Interface (CLI), allowing users to execute different commands, all within a single line.
They will be able to manage various aspects of their lifestyle, from their diet, to exercises and health records.

They can use DukeCooks to manage all their lifestyle needs, all within one single app.

With DukeCooks, being healthy has never been easier!

=== Purpose

This developer guide aims to provide you with both the technical and non-technical aspects of DukeCooks. It also provides
insight into the future direction of DukeCooks. After reading this document, you should be able to understand the design,
architecture and goals of DukeCooks.

=== Understanding the document

[TIP] Pro tips which you may find useful.

NOTE: Information that you should take note of.

WARNING: Information that you should be careful with.

[horizontal]

`Model`:: Text with orange highlight (also known as mark-up) indicates a class / package name.

`__Model.java__`:: Italic text with mark-up indicates a file name / github link.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `11`* or above
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `dukecooks.Main` and try a few commands
. <<Testing#,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the DukeCooks branding and refer to the `AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-2/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `AY1920S1-CS2103T-T10-2/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Documentation#Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based while AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about <<DeveloperGuide#Design-Architecture, DukeCooks's architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/Main.java[`_Main_`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/MainApp.java[`_MainApp_`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name} Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

[discrete]
==== Interaction of architecture components

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete recipe 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete recipe 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/ui/Ui.java[`_Ui.java_`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `XYZListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

[NOTE]
====
XYZListPanel refers to the 6 different individual components in our application.
The 6 different components are:

* Dashboard
* Recipe Book
* Meal Plan
* Exercise
* Health
* Diary
====

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/ui/MainWindow.java[`_MainWindow_`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`_MainWindow.fxml_`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
Structure of the Logic Component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/logic/Logic.java[`_Logic.java_`]

.  `Logic` uses the `DukeCooksParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for simplified interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete recipe 1")` API call.

.Simplified Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete recipe 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/model/Model.java[`_Model.java_`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Duke Cooks data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* BlackBox refers to the model diagram of the individual components of DukeCooks as shown below

.Structure of Workout Model
image::WorkoutPlannerModelClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
XYZ refers to the 5 different individual components in our application.
The 5 different components are:

* Dashboard
* Recipe Book
* Exercise
* Health
* Diary
====

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/storage/Storage.java[`_Storage.java_`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the DukeCooks data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `dukecooks.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Implementation of Commands and Parser
All command variants (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`, `AddExerciseCommand`) extends from `AddCommand`,
instead of the abstract `Command` class.
This applies to other type of commands as well, such as `DeleteCommand` and `EditCommand`.

The diagram below shows a simplified class diagram for Commands and Parser.

.Structure of Commands and Parser
image::CommandImplementation.png[]

{nbsp} +
The current implementation provides the added benefit of easier scalability. Overall, we only need to account for the
type of command (i.e `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand` etc). It's corresponding variants (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`,
`DeleteExerciseCommand`) can simply further extend from it. However, its implementation is rather complex and it increases the amount of code within the repository. For each
command variant added, a corresponding command variant parser needs to be added as well.

*Alternatives*

Another possible structure would be for all command variants to extend from the abstract `Command` class directly.
Although this implementation is simpler, it can greatly increase the number of switch cases within `DukeCooksParser`.
This could potentially increase the difficulty of debugging as it becomes harder to locate the bugs. Furthermore,
this structure exposes all the different types of commands to `DukeCooksParser`.

*Our Choice*

We chose to follow the structure provided in the figure above. As our application is comprised of many different
components with the same variants of commands (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), this structure is more suitable as it
reduces the amount of switch cases within `DukeCooksParser` and makes testing more manageable.

// tag::dashboard[]
=== What makes up a Dashboard?

In DukeCooks, a `Dashboard` object represents an event a user needs to attend to, a task. A `Dashboard` is made up of
a `DashboardName`, `TaskDate` and `TaskStatus`. Below is a class diagram that illustrates how `Dashboard` interacts with other classes.

.Dashboard Class Diagram
[caption="Figure 10: "]
image::DashboardClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== Implementation
The functions add/delete/edit/find/list/done task, are found under the Dashboard. +
The Dashboard in `DukeCooks` serves as a homepage which displays a list of tasks set out
by the user. The tasks are sorted accordingly by earliest date; using a custom sorting algorithm.
Here, a task is represented by a Dashboard object.

The operations are as followed:

* `DukeCooks#add_task()` -- Adds and saves the task into `DukeCooks`.
* `DukeCooks#delete_task()` -- Removes the specified task from `DukeCooks`.
* `DukeCooks#edit_task()` -- Edits the specified with a new task name and/or date.
* `DukeCooks#done()` -- Marks a task as complete.
* `DukeCooks#find_task()` -- Finds a list of task with a given keyword.
* `DukeCooks#list_taskincomlete()` -- Lists all the incomplete tasks.
* `DukeCooks#list_taskcomlete()` -- Lists all the completed tasks.
* `DukeCooks#dashboard()` -- Directs user to the dashboard window.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addDashboard()`,
`Model#deleteDashboard()`, `Model#setDashboard()`, `Model#hasDashboard()` , `Model#doneDashboard` and
`Model#getDashboardRecords()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/delete/edit/find/done/dashboard
mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user is currently at a another part of DukeCooks and wants to go to the Dashboard. The
user executes the `dashboard` command. The `dashboard` command calls `Model#getDashboardRecords()`,
which returns the `ReadOnlyDashboard` that returns the `UniqueDashboardList`, iterating over all the task and displaying it on the
homepage.

Step 2. The user executes `add task tn/bake a cake td/12/12/2019` command to add a new
task into DukeCooks. The `add` command calls `Model#addDashboard()`, causing the task to
be added into `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls
`UniqueDashboardList#add()` which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this
stage, the list of task is sorted by date. After which, the `add` command also calls
`Model#saveDashboard()` to be saved the `dashboard` into the `UniqueDashboardList`.

Step 3. The user executes `delete task 3` command to delete the 3rd task in the
dashboard. The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteDashboard()` causing the specified task
to be removed from `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls
`UniqueDashboardList#remove()` which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this
stage, the list of task is sorted by date. Also, it calls `Model#saveDashboard()`,
after the `delete task 3` command executes
to be saved in the `UniqueDashboardList`.

Step 4. The user executes `edit task...` command to edit a field in a task. The `edit`
command calls `Model#setDashboard()` causing the edited task to be updated in
`UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls `UniqueDashboardList#setDashboard()`
which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this stage, the list of task is
sorted by date. Also, it calls `Model#saveDashboard()`, after the `edit task...` command executes to be saved into the `UniqueDashboardList`

Step 5. The user executes `find task...` command to find a list of task given a keyword.
The `find` command calls `Model#hasDashboard()`, which searches through the
`UniqueDashboardList` for tasks containing the particular keyword.

Step 6. The user executes `done 1` command to mark the first task in the list as complete. The `done`
command calls `Model#doneDashboard()`, which will cause the task to be marked as complete in the
`UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls `UniqueDashboardList#done()`, which adds
the newly created `Dashboard` object and adds it into the list. After which, `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`
is called to sort the list by date and reflect the newly made changes.

The following sequence diagram (Figure 10) shows how the add operation works:

.Done task Sequence Diagram
[caption="Figure 12: "]
image::DoneTaskSequenceDiagram.png[width="550"]

==== Making Decisions

[cols="10%,50%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Storing a task's status
|A custom class, `TaskStatus`, is created to keep track of the task's status.

- Pros: Additional statuses can be introduced in easily in the future. +
- Cons: Because a `String` is used to create a `TaskStatus`, typos could be made when adding test cases. +

This choice was chosen as it does not limit us to only having tasks marked as "COMPLETED" or "NOT COMPLETE".
Since choice 1 was used, additional status, "RECENTLY COMPLETED" could be added with ease.

|Use a boolean to check if a task is complete.

- Pros: Easy to implement.
- Cons: Limits expansion since a task can only be marked as "COMPLETED" or "NOT COMPLETE".

|Sorting tasks by date

|Every time the `add`, `delete`, `edit` task command is called, a `sort` is executed.

- Pros: Easy to implement. Because `sort` is implemented regardless if the list is in-order or not,
there is lesser chance for errors.
- Cons: Because `sort` is executed every time, this might slow down the performance.

This choice was chosen as it reduces the chance of errors and is a safer option.

|Keep an instance of the earliest and latest date. If dates fall out of range from the two dates, sorting does not happen.

- Pros: Faster runtime. +
- Cons: Additional lines of code needed to check if the date falls out of range. Higher chance of making mistakes during implementation.

// end::dashboard[]

=== Recipe Book feature
The current implementation of Recipe Book consists of the following:

* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `RecipeName`
* Each `Recipe` contains an Set of `Ingredient`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Calories`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Carbohydrates`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Fats`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Protein`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Recipe` class.

.Recipe Class Diagram
image::RecipeClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of recipe book commands

`Recipe` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddRecipeCommand` - Adds a `Recipe` into `DukeCooks`
* `DeleteRecipeCommand` - Deletes a `Recipe` from `DukeCooks`
* `EditRecipeCommand` - Edits the specified `Recipe`
* `FindRecipeCommand` - Finds all `Recipe` whose `RecipeName` contains user-specified keywords

All the above recipe commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddRecipeCommandParser`,
`DeleteRecipeCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`,
`DeleteRecipeCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeleteRecipeCommand`.
The input provided is `delete recipe 1`.

.DeleteRecipeCommand Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteRecipeSequenceDiagram.png[]

After a successful execution, the recipe with the specified index will be deleted from the recipe book.

The DeleteRecipeCommand will also delete the recipe from all meal plans that by filtering through all saved meal plans,
checking for the existence of the recipe it is about to delete, and replace that meal plan with a new one. This is done
using MealPlan#removeRecipe.

*Design Considerations*

The current implementation uses the DeleteRecipeCommand to do dynamic deletion of recipes from meal plans whenever
a recipe is deleted.

*Alternatives*

An alternative would be create an update command that would update meal plans upon any changes made to the recipe book,
be it deletion or editing of recipes. This means that the user must manually call for a command that goes through the meal plans
to validate that they are up to date with the recipe book commands.

*Our Choice*

We chose to have the updating of the recipes within meal plans to be done whenever a relevant recipe operation occures,
namely recipe deletion and edition. This provides a better user experience as the user will never need to remember that
they have to run an update every single time they modify their recipes. A similar design consideration and choice was made
for EditRecipeCommand.

=== Meal Plan feature
The current implementation of Meal Plan consists of the following:

* Each `Meal Plan` consists of a unique `MealPlanName`
* Each `Meal Plan` contains 7 Lists of `RecipeName`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Meal Plan` class.

.Meal Plan Class Diagram
image::MealPlanClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of meal plan commands

`MealPlan` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddMealPlanCommand` - Adds a `MealPlan` into `DukeCooks`
* `DeleteMealPlanCommand` - Deletes a `MealPlan` from `DukeCooks`
* `EditMealPlanCommand` - Edits the specified `MealPlan`
* `FindMealPlanCommand` - Finds all `MealPlan` whose `MealPlanName` contains user-specified keywords
* `FindMealPlanWithCommand` Finds all `MealPlan` whose days contain user-specified `RecipeName`.

All the above meal plan commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddMealPlanCommandParser`,
`DeleteMealPlanCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddMealPlanCommand`,
`DeleteMealPlanCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeleteMealPlanCommand`.
The input provided is `delete mealplan 1`.

.DeleteRecipeCommand Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteMealPlanSequenceDiagram.png[]

After a successful execution, the meal plan with the specified index will be deleted from the meal plan book.

*Design Considerations*

The current implementation of `MealPlan` stores recipe data only in the form of `RecipeName`.

*Alternatives*

An alternative would be for meal plans to save all the data the recipe contains within it, namely all of its ingredients,
nutritional value, and once implemented, the difficulty, preparation time, and image, all saved within the meal plan. This
would make the viewing of the meal plan easier as all the relevant information is being stored within the meal plan.

*Our Choice*

We decided to only capture `RecipeName` information within the meal plan, as we concluded that the meal plan need not know
of a recipe's nutritional value, difficulty, preparation time, or image location until the meal plan is viewed by the user.
This allows for smaller storage of meal plans as each meal plan does not need to hold that much information about the recipes
that it contains. Only when the meal plan is viewed will it use the `RecipeName` data it has to query for the rest of that
recipe's information. Additionally, only storing the `RecipeName` makes the implementation of dynamic updating between meal
plans and recipes much easier.

=== Workout Planner feature
==== Implementation
{nbsp} +
*Exercise Management*

Every workout comprises of varying number of exercises. Users can use existing exercises or create their own custom
exercises. Every exercise contains the following information:

* `ExerciseName` representing the name of the exercise
* `MusclesTrained` comprising of the primary `MuscleType` as well as an ArrayList of secondary `MuscleType` trained
* `Intensity` or how demanding the exercise is
* A set of `ExerciseDetails` which are optional additional information of the exercise such as `ExerciseWeight`,
`Distance`, `Sets` and `Repetitions`.

The Exercise class is represented by the following class diagram below.

.Exercise Class Diagram
image::ExerciseClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of Exercise Commands

The `Exercise` class is managed by the following commands :

* `AddExerciseCommand` - Adds a new `Exercise` into `WorkoutPlanner`
* `ClearExerciseCommand` - Clears all the `Exercise` objects in `WorkoutPlanner`
* `DeleteExerciseCommand` - Deletes an `Exercise` specified by an `Index` from `WorkoutPlanner`
* `EditExerciseCommand` - Edits the specified `Exercise` with newly specified information
* `FindExerciseByIntensityCommand` - Lists all `Exercise` objects with the `Intensity` specified
* `FindExerciseByMuscleCommand` - Lists all `Exercise` objects which trains the `MuscleType` specified
* 'FindExerciseCommand' - Lists all `Exercise` objects with `ExerciseName` that contains the string specified
* 'ListExercise' - Lists all 'Exercise' objects in `WorkoutPlanner`

All the commands listed above are parsed in `DukeCooksParser`, invoking the respective Command Parsers
(Add, Delete, Edit etc.). The `Exercise` variant of the parser will then be instantiated
(i.e `AddExerciseCommandParser`,`DeleteExerciseCommandParser` etc) to create the actual command objects
(i.e AddDiaryCommand, DeleteDiaryCommand etc). These Command Objects will then execute the necessary steps
to fulfill their functionality.

*Design Considerations*

When coming up with the Exercise class there were various considerations as to what fields should be added. Initially,
we had planned for MuscleType to be an enum given the limited number of muscles in the human body. However, we had
strayed away from this implementation given the complexity of the way the muscles work as well as the numerous names
that one muscle could be called. We instead allowed the user to define the muscles themselves which is better for their
own understanding. We instead utilised enums for the Intensity field since it is only limited High, Medium and Low.

*Alternatives*

When coming up with the optional details field, `ExerciseDetail` we had morphed the tag feature which was stored in a
Set in AddressBook 3. The various details such as weight, distance would then be implementing the `ExerciseDetail`
interface. After careful consideration, we had come to the conclusion that this method of storage is flawed given that
we only intended for at most one instance of each detail and inability to call upon them at O(1) time complexity.

Instead, we designed the `ExerciseDetails` to be a class with 4 Optional fields containing the various details. This
allows for the details to be obtained more efficiently as well as limit them to only a single instance.


=== Health Records feature
The Health Records feature handles the following:

* Keeping track of the health data recorded by the user
* Present the data with visual representation of a trend graph that shows the health progress of the user

*Proposed Implementation*

The commands that are callable by the user are as followed:

.  `view health` - view the specific type of health records
.  `add health` - adds a new record respective to the type of health records
.  `edit health` - edits a existing health record
.  `delete health` - deletes a existing health record

The class diagram below illustrates the structure of a Health Record class.

.HealthRecords Class Diagram
image::HealthRecordsClassDiagram.png[]

Each Health Record object consist of a Type, Timestamp and Value. The current implementation stores 6 key areas:

1. Weight
2. Height
3. Calories
4. Glucose
5. Blood Pressure
6. Menstrual Cycle (for Females)

[NOTE]
The types available are stored in a list named `TYPE_UTIL`. This means that the validity check of `Type` Object will be checked against `TYPE_UTIL` list. If type does not exist, the record will fail to construct.

In future implementations (possibly in v2.0), the `TYPE_UTIL` list will accommodate more record types defined by the user. This means that there will not be a restriction imposed in health types that can be recorded. User can create a new health type to start health tracking (eg. Sodium level).

==== `add health` Command
`add health t/[type] [inputs]` is parsed in the `addHealthCommandParser`. The inputs will first be initialised to its respective objects with underlying validation checks (eg. `Type` object will call for `isValidType()` method to check against `TYPE_UTIL` List). A `Record` object will then be created with the three valid object components.

The sequence diagram below illustrates a sample run of program where `add health` command has been successfully parsed.

.Sequence Diagram for `add health` command
image::AddHealthSequenceDiagram.png[]


==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: Data structure on how the different health types are stored*

*Alternative 1 (Current Choice)*

Maintain a Map to validate type of health record

A `HashMap` is used to store the different health types and its respective metric unit (eg. Weight, kg). When a health related command is called, the `TYPE_UTIL` will be accessed and checked against to determine if command is valid.

* Pros: Greater flexibility in the implementation and usage of `TYPE_UTIL` Map. Allow possible extension of having more user defined health types.
* Cons: Difficult to keep track of each health type and lack of clarity.


*Alternative 2*

Introduce each health type as a Class on its own

* Pros: Clearer distinction and declaration of each health type
* Cons: Limited to a specific number of health types. User cannot introduce their own health type for record tracking. Requires diligence on developer’s end to introduce new classes for more variations.



=== Diary feature
==== Implementation
The current implementation of Diary consists of the following:

* Each `Diary` consists of a unique `DiaryName`
* Each `Diary` contains an array list of `Page`
* Each `Page` is identified by a unique `Title`, `PageType`, `Page Description` and `Page Image`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Diary` class.

.Diary Class Diagram
image::DiaryClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of diary commands

`Diary` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddDiaryCommand` - Adds a `Diary` into DukeCooks
* `DeleteDiaryCommand` - Deletes a `Diary` from DukeCooks
* `EditDiaryCommand` - Edits the specified `Diary` with a new `DiaryName`
* `ViewDiaryCommand` - Views the specified `Diary` using the provided index
* `FindDiaryCommand` - Finds the specified `Diary` using the provided keyword
* `ListDiaryCommand` - Lists all available diaries to user
* `AddPageCommand` - Adds a new `Page` to the specified `Diary`
* `DeletePageCommand` - Deletes the `Page` in the specified `Diary`
* `EditPageCommand` - Edits various fields of the specified `Page`

All the above commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` first and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddDiaryCommandParser`,
`DeleteDiaryCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddDiaryCommand`,
`DeleteDiaryCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeleteDiaryCommand`.

.Sequence Diagram of DeleteDiaryCommand
image::DeleteDiarySequenceDiagram.png[]

{nbsp} +
After a successful execution, the specified diary will be removed.

==== Design Considerations

The current implementation of `Diary` makes use of an ArrayList to store the `Page` objects.
This is the simplest implementation as most novice programmers would be familiar with ArrayLists.
However, list operations tend to take more time to run compared to other data structures such as Sets.

*Alternatives*

An alternative to using ArrayList would be to use sets to store `Page` objects. This could increase the
overall performance of the program as set operations tend to be faster than list operations. However, using sets
does not provide an order to `Page` objects, unlike in lists.

*Our Choice*

We chose to use ArrayLists instead as we require the `Page` objects to be ordered, so that the implementation of
`DeletePageCommand` is simplified. An index can simply be provided in `DeletePageCommand` and the corresponding `Page`
object can simply be removed from the ArrayList, using the specified index.

==== Implementation of Images

All images used in DukeCooks are copied into an internal data folder and all subsequent loading of images is done from
within this internal folder. The following activity diagram explains how an image is created in DukeCooks:

.Activity diagram of adding images
image::ImageActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

This current implementation of images defensively copies the images into the internal data folder, instead of loading images
from the user's local directory. While it may be slower in terms of performance, it is less prone to unexpected errors when
loading images.

*Alternatives*

An alternative to copying images into an internal data folder would be to load images directly from the user's directory
without saving it internally. This implementation performs better and is much easier to implement.

*Our Choice*

We decided to make defensive copies of images in our internal folder as we want to eliminate unexpected errors. By making
defensive copies internally, we ensure that all images used can be loaded, even if the user decides to delete the original
image in their local directory.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc provides greater flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

You may refer to <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> and learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Editing Diagrams

You may refer to <<UsingPlantUml#, UsingPlantUml.adoc>> and learn how to create and update UML diagrams in the Developer Guide.

=== Publishing Documentation

You may refer to <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> and learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`_build.gradle_`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_
|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute exerciseName |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
====

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

[NOTE]
You may refer to <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more information on how to run tests using Gradle.

=== Types of tests

We have three types of tests:

.  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `dukecooks.StringUtilTest`
.  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `dukecooks.storage.StorageManagerTest`
.  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `dukecooks.LogicManagerTest`

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

You may refer to <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> and learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. Refer to <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. Refer to <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews

When a pull request make changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. Refer to <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`_MainApp.java_`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, DukeCooks depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

. Include third-party libraries in the repository (This bloats the repository size)
. Require developers to download third-party libraries manually (Requires extra work from developers)
