== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== Interaction of architecture components

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete recipe 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete recipe 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `XYZListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

[NOTE]
====
XYZListPanel refers to the 5 different individual components in our application.
The 5 different components are:

* Dashboard
* RecipeBook
* Exercise
* Health
* Diary
====

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
Structure of the Logic Component

image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `DukeCooksParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete recipe 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete recipe 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Duke Cooks data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* BlackBox refers to the model diagram of the individual components of DukeCooks as shown below

.Structure of Workout Model
image::WorkoutPlannerModelClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
XYZ refers to the 5 different individual components in our application.
The 5 different components are:

* Dashboard
* RecipeBook
* Exercise
* Health
* Diary
====

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/dukecooks/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the DukeCooks data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `dukecooks.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Implementation of Commands and Parser
All command variants (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`, `AddExerciseCommand`) extends from `AddCommand`,
instead of the abstract `Command` class.
This applies to other type of commands as well, such as Delete and Edit.

The diagram below shows a simplified class diagram for Commands and Parser

.Structure of Commands and Parser
image::CommandImplementation.png[]

{nbsp} +
The current implementation provides the added benefit of easier scalability. Overall, we only need to account for the
type of command (i.e `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand` etc). It's corresponding variants (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`,
`DeleteExerciseCommand`) can simply further extend from it. However, its implementation is rather complex and it increases the amount of code within the repository. For each
command variant added, a corresponding command variant parser needs to be added as well.

*Alternatives*

Another possible structure would be for all command variants to extend from the abstract `Command` class directly.
Although this implementation is simpler, it can greatly increase the number of switch cases within `DukeCooksParser`.
This could potentially increase the difficulty of debugging as it becomes harder to locate the bugs. Furthermore,
this structure exposes all the different types of commands to `DukeCooksParser`.

*Our Choice*

We chose to follow the structure provided in the figure above. As our application is comprised of many different
components with the same variants of commands (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), this structure is more suitable as it
reduces the amount of switch cases within `DukeCooksParser` and makes testing more manageable.

// tag::dashboard[]
=== What makes up a Dashboard?

In DukeCooks, a `Dashboard` object represents an event a user needs to attend to, a task. A `Dashboard` is made up of
a `DashboardName`, `TaskDate` and `TaskStatus`. Below is a class diagram that illustrates how `Dashboard` interacts with other classes.

.Dashboard Class Diagram
[caption="Figure 10: "]
image::DashboardClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

==== Implementation
The functions add/delete/edit/find/list/done task, are found under the Dashboard. +
The Dashboard in `DukeCooks` serves as a homepage which displays a list of tasks set out
by the user. The tasks are sorted accordingly by earliest date; using a custom sorting algorithm.
Here, a task is represented by a Dashboard object.

The operations are as followed:

* `DukeCooks#add_task()` -- Adds and saves the task into `DukeCooks`.
* `DukeCooks#delete_task()` -- Removes the specified task from `DukeCooks`.
* `DukeCooks#edit_task()` -- Edits the specified with a new task name and/or date.
* `DukeCooks#done()` -- Marks a task as complete.
* `DukeCooks#find_task()` -- Finds a list of task with a given keyword.
* `DukeCooks#list_taskincomlete()` -- Lists all the incomplete tasks.
* `DukeCooks#list_taskcomlete()` -- Lists all the completed tasks.
* `DukeCooks#dashboard()` -- Directs user to the dashboard window.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addDashboard()`,
`Model#deleteDashboard()`, `Model#setDashboard()`, `Model#hasDashboard()` , `Model#doneDashboard` and
`Model#getDashboardRecords()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/delete/edit/find/done/dashboard
mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user is currently at a another part of DukeCooks and wants to go to the Dashboard. The
user executes the `dashboard` command. The `dashboard` command calls `Model#getDashboardRecords()`,
which returns the `ReadOnlyDashboard` that returns the `UniqueDashboardList`, iterating over all the task and displaying it on the
homepage.

Step 2. The user executes `add task tn/bake a cake td/12/12/2019` command to add a new
task into DukeCooks. The `add` command calls `Model#addDashboard()`, causing the task to
be added into `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls
`UniqueDashboardList#add()` which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this
stage, the list of task is sorted by date. After which, the `add` command also calls
`Model#saveDashboard()` to be saved the `dashboard` into the `UniqueDashboardList`.

Step 3. The user executes `delete task 3` command to delete the 3rd task in the
dashboard. The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteDashboard()` causing the specified task
to be removed from `UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls
`UniqueDashboardList#remove()` which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this
stage, the list of task is sorted by date. Also, it calls `Model#saveDashboard()`,
after the `delete task 3` command executes
to be saved in the `UniqueDashboardList`.

Step 4. The user executes `edit task...` command to edit a field in a task. The `edit`
command calls `Model#setDashboard()` causing the edited task to be updated in
`UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls `UniqueDashboardList#setDashboard()`
which will call `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`. At this stage, the list of task is
sorted by date. Also, it calls `Model#saveDashboard()`, after the `edit task...` command executes to be saved into the `UniqueDashboardList`

Step 5. The user executes `find task...` command to find a list of task given a keyword.
The `find` command calls `Model#hasDashboard()`, which searches through the
`UniqueDashboardList` for tasks containing the particular keyword.

Step 6. The user executes `done 1` command to mark the first task in the list as complete. The `done`
command calls `Model#doneDashboard()`, which will cause the task to be marked as complete in the
`UniqueDashboardList`. In `UniqueDashboardList`, it calls `UniqueDashboardList#done()`, which adds
the newly created `Dashboard` object and adds it into the list. After which, `UniqueDashboardList#sortDashboard()`
is called to sort the list by date and reflect the newly made changes.

The following sequence diagram (Figure 10) shows how the add operation works:

.Done task Sequence Diagram
[caption="Figure 12: "]
image::DoneTaskSequenceDiagram.png[width="550"]

==== Making Decisions

[cols="10%,50%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Storing a task's status
|A custom class, `TaskStatus`, is created to keep track of the task's status.

- Pros: Additional statuses can be introduced in easily in the future. +
- Cons: Because a `String` is used to create a `TaskStatus`, typos could be made when adding test cases. +

This choice was chosen as it does not limit us to only having tasks marked as "COMPLETED" or "NOT COMPLETE".
Since choice 1 was used, additional status, "RECENTLY COMPLETED" could be added with ease.

|Use a boolean to check if a task is complete.

- Pros: Easy to implement.
- Cons: Limits expansion since a task can only be marked as "COMPLETED" or "NOT COMPLETE".

|Sorting tasks by date

|Every time the `add`, `delete`, `edit` task command is called, a `sort` is executed.

- Pros: Easy to implement. Because `sort` is implemented regardless if the list is in-order or not,
there is lesser chance for errors.
- Cons: Because `sort` is executed every time, this might slow down the performance.

This choice was chosen as it reduces the chance of errors and is a safer option.

|Keep an instance of the earliest and latest date. If dates fall out of range from the two dates, sorting does not happen.

- Pros: Faster runtime. +
- Cons: Additional lines of code needed to check if the date falls out of range. Higher chance of making mistakes during implementation.
|===
// end::dashboard[]

=== RecipeBook feature
The current implementation of RecipeBook consists of the following:

* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `name`
* Each `Recipe` contains an Set of `Ingredient`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Calories`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Carbohydrates`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Fats`
* Each `Recipe` consists of a unique `Protein`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Recipe` class.

.Recipe Class Diagram
image::RecipeClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of recipe book commands

`Recipe` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddRecipeCommand` - Adds a `Recipe` into `DukeCooks`
* `DeleteRecipeCommand` - Deletes a `Recipe` from `DukeCooks`
* `EditRecipeCommand` - Edits the specified `Recipe`
* `FindRecipeCommand` - Finds all `Recipe` whose `name` contains user-specified keywords

All the above recipe commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddRecipeCommandParser`,
`DeleteRecipeCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddRecipeCommand`,
`DeleteRecipeCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeleteRecipeCommand`.
The input provided is `delete recipe 1`.

.DeleteRecipeCommand Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

After a successful execution, the recipe with the specified index will be deleted from the recipe book.

The current implementation makes use of an Sets to store the `Ingredient` objects.
This is the easiest way to implement the `Ingredient` component of the recipe as it builds on the existing codebase
of ab3.

*Alternatives*

An alternative would be to use an ArrayList instead of Sets to store `Ingredient` objects. This would make the
implementation of `Ingredient` specific objects easier as they could be referenced through indexing of the ArrayList,
which is more straight forward.

*Our Choice*

We will soon implement ArrayLists instead as the current implementation of `Ingredient` objects using Sets do not allow
for ease of use for the user whenever the user wishes to edit `Ingredient` objects present within a `Recipe`.

=== Workout Planner feature

The workout feature allows users to create their own custom workouts with `add Workout` command and adding their own
custom exercises to it with `push exercise`. With these custom workouts, they can then choose to run them through
`run workout` and monitor their progress and workout history with `view workout`.

==== Implementation

{nbsp} +
*Workout Management*

Every workout comprises of the following information:

* `WorkoutName` representing the name of the workout
* `Average Intensity` representing the average demands of the exercises in the workout
* A set of `MuscleType` which represents all the muscles trained by the workout
* An ArrayList of `ExerciseName` of exercises that would be carried out in the workout
* `WorkoutHistory` containing information on all the previous runs of the workout as well as some statistics

The Workout Class also contains the function `updateHistory(WorkoutRun run)` which adds the `WorkoutRun` into the
WorkoutHistory and updates all the relevant fields accordingly, returning a new Workout instance with updated `WorkoutHistory`.
The class also utilises `pushExercise(Exercise exercise, Set<ExerciseDetail> details)` function to add new `Exercise` and
return a new Workout with update fields. There is also an option to push an exercise without the details with the overloaded
method which instead opts to use the pre-built Set of `ExerciseDetails` in the `Exercise` itself.

The Workout Class is represented by the class diagram below.

.Workout Class Diagram
image::WorkoutClassDiagram.png[]

The Workout Class is managed by the following commands:

* `AddWorkoutCommand` - Adds a new empty `Workout` into `WorkoutPlanner`
* `DeleteWorkoutCommand` - Deletes a `Workout` specified by an `Index` from `WorkoutPlanner`
* `PushExerciseCommand` - Pushes an `Exercise` specified by an `Index` into an existing `Workout`


{nbsp} +
*Exercise Management*

In order to run a `Workout`, users will have to add `Exercises` into the `Workout` as an empty workout cannot be ran.
Users can use existing exercises or create their own custom exercises. Every exercise contains the following information:

* `ExerciseName` representing the name of the exercise
* `MusclesTrained` comprising of the primary `MuscleType` as well as an ArrayList of secondary `MuscleType` trained
* `Intensity` or how demanding the exercise is
* A set of `ExerciseDetails` which are optional additional information of the exercise such as `ExerciseWeight`,
`Distance`, `Sets` and `Repetitions`
* `ExerciseHistory` containing information on all the previous `ExerciseRun` of the exercise

Like `Workout`, `Exercise` also has the method `updateHistory` which returns an updated Exercise with a new
`ExerciseRun` accounted for.

The Exercise class is represented by the following class diagram below.

.Exercise Class Diagram
image::ExerciseClassDiagram.png[]

The `Exercise` class is managed by the following commands :

* `AddExerciseCommand` - Adds a new `Exercise` into `WorkoutPlanner`
* `ClearExerciseCommand` - Clears all the `Exercise` objects in `WorkoutPlanner`
* `DeleteExerciseCommand` - Deletes an `Exercise` specified by an `Index` from `WorkoutPlanner`
* `EditExerciseCommand` - Edits the specified `Exercise` with newly specified information
* `FindExerciseByIntensityCommand` - Lists all `Exercise` objects with the `Intensity` specified
* `FindExerciseByMuscleCommand` - Lists all `Exercise` objects which trains the `MuscleType` specified
* 'FindExerciseCommand' - Lists all `Exercise` objects with `ExerciseName` that contains the string specified
* 'ListExercise' - Lists all 'Exercise' objects in `WorkoutPlanner`

All the exercise and workout commands above are parsed in `DukeCooksParser`, invoking the respective Command Parsers
(Add, Delete, Edit etc.). The `Exercise`/`Workout` variant of the parser will then be instantiated
(i.e `AddExerciseCommandParser`,`DeleteWorkoutCommandParser` etc) to create the actual command objects
(i.e AddExerciseCommand, DeleteWorkoutCommand etc). These Command Objects will then execute the necessary steps
to fulfill their functionality.

{nbsp} +
*Running of Workouts*

The core functionality of the WorkoutPlanner is to run a `Workout` and have it automatically tracking your progress
by making records in its history. This is done through the `Run Workout Command`. The following sequence diagrams show
what happens when the command is invoked.

.Sequence Diagram of RunWorkoutCommand
image::RunWorkoutSequenceDiagram.png[]

As seen in the diagram above, when the command is invoked, the `RunWorkoutParser` is initialised to parse the argument String
to initialise `RunWorkoutCommand`. The Command object will then run its execute method, which calls upon get method of
UniqueWorkoutList to obtain the target `Workout`. The target workout and message will then be passed back to the Ui through
the CommandResult object. The Ui will then boot a new `RunWorkoutWindow` with the targeted workout.

.Sequence Diagram of UpdateWorkoutCommand
image::RunWorkoutSequenceDiagram1.png[]

Upon completion of the workout, the Ui will immediately generate a new `UpdateWorkoutCommand` containing the `Workout`
that has been ran and a newly instantiated `WorkoutRun` with the details of the run. `UpdateWorkoutCommand` will then
be executed and the following will occur:

. New Workout will be generated. +
Using Workout's `updateHistory` method, a new updated `Workout` will be created.
. The outdated Workout will be replaced by the new Workout. +
Using `UniqueWorkoutList` 's `setWorkout` method, the old workout will be removed and the updated one will be placed in
its stead
. CommandResult is generated and passed back to Ui. +
A new CommandResult will be returned containing a congratulatory message to the Ui signalling the successful completion
of the workout.

*Design Considerations*

[cols="10%,50%,40%""]
[width="100%"]
|===
|Aspect |Option 1 (Chosen)|Option 2

|Storing an Exercise/Workout's intensity
|Intensity was stored as an Enumeration instead of a class

- Pros: Intensity can be limited only a specific amount of values +

- Cons: Intensity will only be an estimate instead of a specific value given the value limits +

This option was chosen in the end to simplify the classification of exercise so that users can more easily filter by
intensity. Furthermore, this allows for more Ui diversification by having different images for each intensity.

|Setting Intensity as a Class

- Pros: Easy to implement.

- Cons: Makes filtering by intensity a more tedious affair for both developers and users.

|Storing MuscleTypes

|Have MuscleType be a class on its own

- Pros: Muscles are referred to by various names and allowing the user to set their own muscle names allow for more
familiarity

- Cons: MuscleType class will require stricter validation to ensure that users do not mess up the programme with unintended
inputs.

This option was chosen to allow for greater flexibility of naming for the muscle types but at the same time still limited
to prevent the users from going wild.

|Store MuscleType as an enumeration

- Pros: There are limited muscles in the body, allowing for a proper limit +

- Cons: Muscles may have multiple names that are not accounted for by the enum.

|Storage of Exercises in Workout
|Workouts only store a list of ExerciseName and not the full exercise

- Pros: Exercises only have to be edited once upon execution of edit command - more cost effective. It also avoids
unnecessarily large storage files. +

- Cons: Each time an exercise of workout has to be referenced, the entire storage of exercise has to be scoured

In the end we decided to choose this option as we foresee that the edit command will be utilised more often than calling
an exercise from a workout. Furthermore, to improve timing, we kept a sorted storage for exercise to allow for the quicker
binary search.

| Workouts store whole Exercises

- Pros : Exercises can be extracted quickly
- Cons : Huge storage space is required. Also complicates editing of exercises.
|===

=== Health Records feature
The Health Records feature handles the following:

* Keeping track of the health data recorded by the user
* Present the data with visual representation of a trend graph that shows the health progress of the user

*Proposed Implementation*

The commands that are callable by the user are as followed:

.  `view health` - view the specific type of health records
.  `add health` - adds a new record respective to the type of health records
.  `edit health` - edits a existing health record
.  `delete health` - deletes a existing health record

The class diagram below illustrates the structure of a Health Record class.

.HealthRecords Class Diagram
image::HealthRecordsClassDiagram.png[]

Each Health Record object consist of a Type, Timestamp and Value. The current implementation stores 6 key areas:

1. Weight
2. Height
3. Calories
4. Glucose
5. Blood Pressure
6. Menstrual Cycle (for Females)

[NOTE]
The types available are stored in a list named `TYPE_UTIL`. This means that the validity check of `Type` Object will be checked against `TYPE_UTIL` list. If type does not exist, the record will fail to construct.

In future implementations (possibly in v2.0), the `TYPE_UTIL` list will accommodate more record types defined by the user. This means that there will not be a restriction imposed in health types that can be recorded. User can create a new health type to start health tracking (eg. Sodium level).

==== `add health` Command
`add health t/[type] [inputs]` is parsed in the `addHealthCommandParser`. The inputs will first be initialised to its respective objects with underlying validation checks (eg. `Type` object will call for `isValidType()` method to check against `TYPE_UTIL` List). A `Record` object will then be created with the three valid object components.

The sequence diagram below illustrates a sample run of program where `add health` command has been successfully parsed.

.Sequence Diagram for `add health` command
image::AddHealthSequenceDiagram.png[]


==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: Data structure on how the different health types are stored*

*Alternative 1 (Current Choice)*

Maintain a Map to validate type of health record

A `HashMap` is used to store the different health types and its respective metric unit (eg. Weight, kg). When a health related command is called, the `TYPE_UTIL` will be accessed and checked against to determine if command is valid.

* Pros: Greater flexibility in the implementation and usage of `TYPE_UTIL` Map. Allow possible extension of having more user defined health types.
* Cons: Difficult to keep track of each health type and lack of clarity.


*Alternative 2*

Introduce each health type as a Class on its own

* Pros: Clearer distinction and declaration of each health type
* Cons: Limited to a specific number of health types. User cannot introduce their own health type for record tracking. Requires diligence on developer’s end to introduce new classes for more variations.



=== Diary feature
==== Implementation
The current implementation of Diary consists of the following:

* Each `Diary` consists of a unique `DiaryName`
* Each `Diary` contains an array list of `Page`
* Each `Page` is identified by a unique `Title`
* Each class has their respective getter methods

The class diagram below gives an overview of the `Diary` class.

.Diary Class Diagram
image::DiaryClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of diary commands

`Diary` class supports multiple commands. It includes:

* `AddDiaryCommand` - Adds a `Diary` into `DukeCooks`
* `DeleteDiaryCommand` - Deletes a `Diary` from `DukeCooks`
* `EditDiaryCommand` - Edits the specified `Diary` with a new `DiaryName`
* `AddPageCommand` - Adds a new `Page` to the specified `Diary`
* `DeletePageCommand` - Deletes the `Page` in the specified `Diary`

All the above diary commands behave similarly. The commands will be parsed in `DukeCooksParser` and based on their
types (i.e Add, Delete, Edit etc), the corresponding variant parsers will be invoked (i.e `AddDiaryCommandParser`,
`DeleteDiaryCommandParser` etc). After which, the corresponding command will be executed (i.e `AddDiaryCommand`,
`DeleteDiaryCommand` etc).

The figure below describes the execution of an `DeletePageCommand`.

.Sequence Diagram of DeletePageCommand
image::DeletePageSequenceDiagram.png[]

{nbsp} +
After a successful execution, the specified page will be removed from the specified diary.

The current implementation makes use of an ArrayList to store the `Page` objects.
This is the simplest implementation as most novice programmers would be familiar with ArrayLists.
However, list operations tend to take more time to run compared to other data structures such as Sets.

*Alternatives*

An alternative to using ArrayList would be to use sets to store `Page` objects. This could increase the
overall performance of the program as set operations tend to be faster than list operations. However, using sets
does not provide an order to `Page` objects, unlike in lists.

*Our Choice*

We chose to use ArrayLists instead as we require the `Page` objects to be ordered, so that the implementation of
`DeletePageCommand` is simplified. An index can be provided in `DeletePageCommand` and the corresponding `Page`
object can simply be removed from the ArrayList, using the specified index.



=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
