== PROJECT: DukeCooks

---

== What is in this document?

This document is a project portfolio documenting the contributions made for DukeCooks by the writer - Hua Lun . It will present the user and developer guide of the Dashboard function in Duke cooks.

== What exactly is DukeCooks?

DukeCooks is a one-stop healthy lifestyle Desktop application capable of managing your tasks, storing recipes, planning workouts, writing blogs and monitoring your health. DukeCooks is made with the mindset of busy individuals. As college students, we understand the struggles of maintaining a schedule and keeping notes. Not to mention, keeping a balanced and healthy body on top of all the workload.

Current applications in the market can satisfy one out of the many needs we have. This would mean that we would have to download and keep track of a myriad of applications in our system.

Here in Duke cooks, we hope to eliminate; simplify these tedious and stressful chores, all just in one single application. DukeCooks is equipped with a command-line interface (CLI). With this CLI all you have to do is key in what you want to do with an array of predefined commands ranging from adding tasks to writing a new diary entry. Then, all you have to do is sit back, relax and let DukeCooks do all the dirty work!

== Who is behind DukeCooks?

DukeCooks is proudly developed by a group of second-year students from the National University of Singapore. This application was made to fit the team project requirement of the CS2103T module. An application, AddressBook 3 (AB3), was assigned as a base for our project. Thus, this is a brownfield project which entails morphing AB3 into a new application which in this case, DukeCooks.

== My Contributions to DukeCooks

=== Building the Dashboard

The Dashboard in DukeCooks provides an overview of the list of tasks to be done. It is also coupled with a progress bar, mini calendar and joke column.

Initial works for the Dashboard include referencing the AB3  codebase. The add / delete / edit / list / find functions from AB3 was adapted and available in the Dashboard. As a comparison, the functions listed before was used in AB3 to create and manipulate a person's contact information. In DukeCook’s Dashboard, these functions are used to create and manipulate a task's information.

=== Enhancement 1: Creating the `done` command

The done command was created to complement the Dashboard. The user is able to use the command done, to mark a task as complete. Whenever a 'done' command is executed, the progress bar will refresh and update to display the latest information.

=== Enhancement 2: Adding more functionality to the `list` command

The 'list' function adapted from ABS only list all the items in the list. In the case of a dashboard, this might not be adequate. As such, 2 additional functions were added to the `list` command.

By entering `list taskcomplete` or `list taskincomplete` will display the list of task marked as complete or task that are not complete respectively.

=== Enhancement 3: Upgrading the Graphic User Interface (GUI)

Using AB3’s GUI as a backbone, the Dashboard was created. In the GUI for the Dashboard, it displays a progress bar which shows the progress of the tasks completed. A date picker is used to allow users to have quick access to the calendar. Lastly, as a way to motivate users to complete their task, a column is created for displaying jokes. In order to view a joke, users will have to mark a number of task as done.

=== Enhancement 4: Sorting tasks by date

Based off AB3's add command, the task that is last added will be display at the last of the list. Hence, in order to improve user's experience, a sorting system is built. Now, when a task is added, the task will be displayed based off the date entered in.
