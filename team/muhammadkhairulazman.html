<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you&#8217;re back, I can finally tell you about the wonderful team behind the application. DukeCooks is developed by a
team of Year 2 Undergraduates from National University College as part of a software engineering module. Having 2 members
who stayed in campus, it was originally designed to be a recipe book that can schedule your meal plans to ease shopping.
However we realised the potential that the project could fulfill since a huge part of health starts in eating healthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We thus added various extensions integral to a healthier lifestyle while retaining the core feature and name, DukeCooks, allowing
it to become what it is today.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Workout Planner in Duke Cooks is used to create your own custom workout regimes. These workouts contains exercises that
are built into the application or can be created by the users. Users can then run the workout routine with run command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The management of Workouts and Exercises is done through Commands similar to that of the AddressBook3, the application DukeCooks
was built on. These Commands include the add, clear, find, list, delete and edit Commands.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initial find function can only be used to filter the exercise list by name. However, users may be interested in creating a
workout of only a level of intensity or targeting one muscle group. By entering <code>find exerciseMuscle &lt;MuscleType&gt;</code> or
<code>find exerciseIntensity &lt;Intensity&gt;</code>, users can view muscle/intensity specific exercises.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When workouts are first added, they are empty and do not contain any exercises. Hence to populate the workout, you can
use the <code>push exercise</code> command to add an exercise into the workout. The application will then automatically update all the
fields in workout to reflect the new addition in exercise.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>What good is a workout if you cannot run it? After filling your workout with all the exercises you plan to do, you can then
execute the workout with the <code>run workout</code> command. A new window will open, showing all the details you need for each set of
exercises as well as a progress bar to keep track of your completion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon completion you will be greeted with a congratulatory message and the workout records will be updated accordingly.</p>

<p>After each run, the history of each Workout and Exercises will be automatically updated and can seen using the

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Workout Class also contains the function <code>updateHistory(WorkoutRun run)</code> which adds the <code>WorkoutRun</code> into the
WorkoutHistory and updates all the relevant fields accordingly, returning a new Workout instance with updated <code>WorkoutHistory</code>.
The class also utilises <code>pushExercise(Exercise exercise, Set&lt;ExerciseDetail&gt; details)</code> function to add new <code>Exercise</code> and
return a new Workout with update fields. There is also an option to push an exercise without the details with the overloaded
method which instead opts to use the pre-built Set of <code>ExerciseDetails</code> in the <code>Exercise</code> itself.</p>

<p>All the exercise and workout commands above are parsed in <code>DukeCooksParser</code>, invoking the respective Command Parsers

<strong>Running of Workouts</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core functionality of the WorkoutPlanner is to run a <code>Workout</code> and have it automatically tracking your progress
by making records in its history. This is done through the <code>Run Workout Command</code>. The following sequence diagrams show
what happens when the command is invoked.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 10. Sequence Diagram of RunWorkoutCommand</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As seen in the diagram above, when the command is invoked, the <code>RunWorkoutParser</code> is initialised to parse the argument String
to initialise <code>RunWorkoutCommand</code>. The Command object will then run its execute method, which calls upon get method of
UniqueWorkoutList to obtain the target <code>Workout</code>. The target workout and message will then be passed back to the Ui through
the CommandResult object. The Ui will then boot a new <code>RunWorkoutWindow</code> with the targeted workout.</p>

<p>Upon completion of the workout, the Ui will immediately generate a new <code>UpdateWorkoutCommand</code> containing the <code>Workout</code>
that has been ran and a newly instantiated <code>WorkoutRun</code> with the details of the run. <code>UpdateWorkoutCommand</code> will then
be executed and the following will occur:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>New Workout will be generated.<br>
Using Workout&#8217;s <code>updateHistory</code> method, a new updated <code>Workout</code> will be created.</p>

Using <code>UniqueWorkoutList</code> 's <code>setWorkout</code> method, the old workout will be removed and the updated one will be placed in
its stead</p>

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Intensity was stored as an Enumeration instead of a class</p>
<p class="tableblock">- Pros: Intensity can be limited only a specific amount of values<br>
- Cons: Intensity will only be an estimate instead of a specific value given the value limits<br>
This option was chosen in the end to simplify the classification of exercise so that users can easily filter by
intensity. Furthermore, this allows for more Ui diversification by having different images for each intensity.</p></td>
<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Setting Intensity as a Class</p>
<p class="tableblock">- Pros: Easy to implement.<br>
- Cons: Makes filtering by intensity a more tedious affair for both developers and users.</p></td>

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Workouts only store a list of ExerciseName and not the full exercise</p>
<p class="tableblock">- Pros: Exercises only have to be edited once upon execution of edit command - more cost effective. It also avoids
unnecessarily large storage files.<br>
- Cons: Each time an exercise of workout has to be referenced, the entire storage of exercise has to be scoured<br>
In the end we decided to choose this option as we foresee that the edit command will be utilised more often than calling
an exercise from a workout. Furthermore, to improve timing, we kept a sorted storage for exercise to allow for the quicker
binary search.</p></td>
<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Workouts store whole Exercises</p>
<p class="tableblock">- Pros : Exercises can be extracted quickly<br>
- Cons : Huge storage space is required. Also complicates editing of exercises.</p></td>
