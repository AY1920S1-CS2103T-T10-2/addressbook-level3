<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you&#8217;re back, I can finally tell you about the wonderful team behind the application. DukeCooks is developed by a
team of Year 2 Undergraduates from National University College as part of a software engineering module. Having 2 members
who stayed in campus, it was originally designed to be a recipe book that can schedule your meal plans to ease shopping.
However we realised the potential that the project could realise since a huge part of health starts in eating healthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We thus added various extensions integral to a healthier lifestyle while retaining the core feature and name, DukeCooks, allowing
it to become what it is today.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Workout Planner in Duke Cooks is used to create your own custom workout regimes. These workouts contains exercises that
are built into the application or can be created by the users. Users can then run the workout routine with run command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The management of Workouts and Exercises is done through Commands similar to that of the AddressBook3, the application DukeCooks
was built on. These Commands include the add, clear, find, list, delete and edit Commands/</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initial find function can be used to filter the exercise list by name. However, users may be interested in creating a
workout of only on level of intensity or targeting one muscle group. By entering <code>find exerciseMuscle &lt;MuscleType&gt;</code> or
<code>find exerciseIntensity &lt;Intensity&gt;</code>, users can view muscle/intensity specific exercises.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When workouts are first added, they are empty and do not contain any exercises. Hence to populate the workout, you can
use the <code>push exercise</code> command to add an exercise into the workout. The application will then automatically update all the
fields in workout to reflect the new addition in exercise.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>What good is a workout if you cannot run it? After filling your workout with all the exercises you plan to do, you can then
execute the workout with the <code>run workout</code> command. A new window will open, showing all the details you need for each set of
exercises as well as a progress bar to keep track of your completion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon completion you will be greeted with a congratulatory message and the workout records will be updated accordingly.</p>

<p>As seen in the screenshot above, the Workout Planner screen is similar to the other screens, with the main

Workout Planner begins with prebuilt Exercises and Workouts installed to get you started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over on the left, is the list of Exercise Cards. Each card informs you of the name, primary muscle as well as the
intensity of the exercise. To get more information of the exercise, you can use the view command which will be covered
in section 3.7.3 of the User Guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly on the right we have the list of Workout Cards. The Workout Cards shows the Workout name, the number of
Exercises in the workout as well as the last time the workout was ran. You can also tell the intensity of the
workout from the image of the card.</p>

<p>"I now know the components of the Workout Planner! So what can I do with it?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well I&#8217;m glad you asked kind person! To start off, we have the add exercise command which creates new
exercises for your workouts. To add an exercise, you must first specify its name, primary muscle trained as well
as its intensity. You can also add optional fields such as secondary muscles and exercise details like sets and reps.
The following shows all the possible fields that can be added:<br>
* Name<br>
* Primary Muscle<br>
* Intensity<br>
* Secondary Muscles (optional)<br>
* Number of sets (optional)<br>
* Number of repetitions (optional)<br>
* Timing (optional) <br>
* Distance (optional)<br>
* Exercise Weight (optional)<br>
To add the exercise, simply input the fields in the Command Box in the following format:<br>
Format: <code>add exercise n/EXERCISE_NAME p/PRIMARY_MUSCLE sm/SECONDARY_MUSCLE i/INTENSITY
s/SETS r/REPETITIONS d/ DISTANCE w/WEIGHT t/TIMING</code></p>

<strong>Workout Management</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every workout comprises of the following information:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>WorkoutName</code> representing the name of the workout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Average Intensity</code> representing the average demands of the exercises in the workout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of <code>MuscleType</code> which represents all the muscles trained by the workout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ArrayList of <code>ExerciseName</code> of exercises that would be carried out in the workout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>WorkoutHistory</code> containing information on all the previous runs of the workout as well as some statistics</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Workout Class also contains the function <code>updateHistory(WorkoutRun run)</code> which adds the <code>WorkoutRun</code> into the
WorkoutHistory and updates all the relevant fields accordingly, returning a new Workout instance with updated <code>WorkoutHistory</code>.
The class also utilises <code>pushExercise(Exercise exercise, Set&lt;ExerciseDetail&gt; details)</code> function to add new <code>Exercise</code> and
return a new Workout with update fields. There is also an option to push an exercise without the details with the overloaded
method which instead opts to use the pre-built Set of <code>ExerciseDetails</code> in the <code>Exercise</code> itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Workout Class is represented by the class diagram below.</p>

<strong>Exercise Management</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to run a <code>Workout</code>, users will have to add <code>Exercises</code> into the <code>Workout</code> as an empty workout cannot be ran.
Users can use existing exercises or create their own custom exercises. Every exercise contains the following information:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ExerciseName</code> representing the name of the exercise</p>

<li>
<p><code>MusclesTrained</code> comprising of the primary <code>MuscleType</code> as well as an ArrayList of secondary <code>MuscleType</code> trained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Intensity</code> or how demanding the exercise is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of <code>ExerciseDetails</code> which are optional additional information of the exercise such as <code>ExerciseWeight</code>,
<code>Distance</code>, <code>Sets</code> and <code>Repetitions</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>ExerciseHistory</code> containing information on all the previous <code>ExerciseRun</code> of the exercise</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like <code>Workout</code>, <code>Exercise</code> also has the method <code>updateHistory</code> which returns an updated Exercise with a new

<p>All the exercise and workout commands above are parsed in <code>DukeCooksParser</code>, invoking the respective Command Parsers
(Add, Delete, Edit etc.). The <code>Exercise</code>/<code>Workout</code> variant of the parser will then be instantiated
(i.e <code>AddExerciseCommandParser</code>,<code>DeleteWorkoutCommandParser</code> etc) to create the actual command objects
(i.e AddExerciseCommand, DeleteWorkoutCommand etc). These Command Objects will then execute the necessary steps
to fulfill their functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#160;<br>
<strong>Running of Workouts</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core functionality of the WorkoutPlanner is to run a <code>Workout</code> and have it automatically tracking your progress
by making records in its history. This is done through the <code>Run Workout Command</code>. The following sequence diagrams show
what happens when the command is invoked.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 24. Sequence Diagram of RunWorkoutCommand</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As seen in the diagram above, when the command is invoked, the <code>RunWorkoutParser</code> is initialised to parse the argument String
to initialise <code>RunWorkoutCommand</code>. The Command object will then run its execute method, which calls upon get method of
UniqueWorkoutList to obtain the target <code>Workout</code>. The target workout and message will then be passed back to the Ui through
the CommandResult object. The Ui will then boot a new <code>RunWorkoutWindow</code> with the targeted workout.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 25. Activity Diagram of RunWorkoutWindow</div>

<p>The user will then run each set of each exercise until the workout is complete. The full loop is demonstrated in the
activity diagram in Figure 17.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon completion of the workout, the Ui will immediately generate a new <code>UpdateWorkoutCommand</code> containing the <code>Workout</code>
that has been ran and a newly instantiated <code>WorkoutRun</code> with the details of the run. <code>UpdateWorkoutCommand</code> will then
be executed and the following will occur:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>New Workout will be generated.<br>
Using Workout&#8217;s <code>updateHistory</code> method, a new updated <code>Workout</code> will be created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The outdated Workout will be replaced by the new Workout.<br>
Using <code>UniqueWorkoutList</code> 's <code>setWorkout</code> method, the old workout will be removed and the updated one will be placed in
its stead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CommandResult is generated and passed back to Ui.<br>
A new CommandResult will be returned containing a congratulatory message to the Ui signalling the successful completion
of the workout.</p>

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Have MuscleType be a class on its own</p>
<p class="tableblock">- Pros: Muscles are referred to by various names and allowing the user to set their own muscle names allow for more
familiarity</p>
<p class="tableblock">- Cons: MuscleType class will require stricter validation to ensure that users do not mess up the programme with unintended
inputs.</p>
<p class="tableblock">This option was chosen to allow for greater flexibility of naming for the muscle types but at the same time still limited

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Store MuscleType as an enumeration</p>

<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Workouts only store a list of ExerciseName and not the full exercise</p>
<p class="tableblock">- Pros: Exercises only have to be edited once upon execution of edit command - more cost effective. It also avoids
unnecessarily large storage files.<br></p>
<p class="tableblock">- Cons: Each time an exercise of workout has to be referenced, the entire storage of exercise has to be scoured</p>
<p class="tableblock">In the end we decided to choose this option as we foresee that the edit command will be utilised more often than calling
an exercise from a workout. Furthermore, to improve timing, we kept a sorted storage for exercise to allow for the quicker
binary search.</p></td>
<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Workouts store whole Exercises</p>
<p class="tableblock">- Pros : Exercises can be extracted quickly
- Cons : Huge storage space is required. Also complicates editing of exercises.</p></td>
