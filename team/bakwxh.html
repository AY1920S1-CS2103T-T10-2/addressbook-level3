<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DukeCooks is a one-stop healthy lifestyle Desktop application designed for health-conscious students.
As busy student project developers for DukeCooks, we understand that it can be daunting to keep track of various
tasks and yet, manage a healthy lifestyle at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DukeCooks aims to simplify this by allowing you to manage various aspects of your lifestyle, all within a single application.
In DukeCooks, you will be able to manage tasks, store recipes, plan workouts, monitor health and write diaries, all in the same application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DukeCooks is equipped with a command-line interface (CLI). With CLI all you have to do is key in what you want to do
with an array of predefined commands.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DukeCooks is proudly developed by a group of second-year students from the National University of Singapore.
This application was made to fit the team project requirements for a software engineering module.
An application, AddressBook 3 (AB3), was assigned as a base for our project.
Thus, this is a brownfield project which entails morphing AB3 into a new application which in this case, DukeCooks.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-recipe-book"><a class="link" href="#building-the-recipe-book">Building the Recipe Book</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Recipe Book in DukeCooks allows the user to create and store his own personal recipes. This allows the user to keep
track of each recipe&#8217;s ingredients and nutritional value, to aid them in monitoring the food they eat, and their
nutritional intake.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initial works for the Recipe Book include referencing the AB3 codebase. The add / delete / edit / list / find functions
from AB3 were adapted and are made available in Recipe Book.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using AB3’s GUI as a backbone, the Recipe Book was created. The GUI layout was adapted to have an sidebar index view of
every <code>Recipe</code> saved within DukeCooks, as well as a separate panel that display all of the saved <code>Recipe</code> as Recipe Cards
for the user&#8217;s ease of view.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Tag</code> component from AB3 was refactored to function as <code>Ingredient</code>. However, with AB3&#8217;s implementation of tags,
and edits to a <code>Recipe</code> to update its ingredients would follow the behaviour of AB3&#8217;s <code>Tag</code>, meaning it would clear all
of the <code>Ingredient</code> present in that <code>Recipe</code> and give that <code>Recipe</code> the <code>Ingredient</code> specified by the user. To allow for
a better user experience, these components have been modified such that the user is able to solely add and remove <code>Ingredient</code>
components from a <code>Recipe</code>, as opposed to having to retype all of the <code>Ingredient</code> a <code>Recipe</code> should have every edit.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="enhancement-3-dynamic-updates-between-recipe-book-and-meal-plan-book"><a class="link" href="#enhancement-3-dynamic-updates-between-recipe-book-and-meal-plan-book">Enhancement 3: Dynamic updates between Recipe Book and Meal Plan Book</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given that the Recipe Book and Meal Plan Book are two closely related components, optimizations were made to the Recipe
Book methods such that any modifications made by the user to the <code>Recipe</code> stored within the Recipe Book would be reflected
within the <code>MealPlan</code> in the MealPlan book automatically, without the user having to prompt for an update to ensure Meal Plans
are up to date with the Recipe Book&#8217;s latest information.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-meal-plan-book"><a class="link" href="#building-the-meal-plan-book">Building the Meal Plan Book</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Meal Plan Book in DukeCooks allows the user to create and organize his own meal plans. This allows the user to add
recipes that he has saved into the DukeCooks recipe book, allowing him to plan his weekly intake of food and nutritional
value. The Meal Plan Book will calculate and display the weekly nutritional value to the user upon the user&#8217;s request.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To give the user ease in processing the nutritional value of an entire meal plan, as well as to better view the <code>Recipe</code>
present in each <code>MealPlan</code>, the <code>view</code> command was created. The <code>view</code> command takes advantage of the revamped GUI and removes
the Meal Plan Card view to bring up a new GUI that displays all of the <code>Recipe</code> of each day of the viewed <code>MealPlan</code>, including
the <code>RecipeName</code>, <code>Ingredient</code>, and various nutritional value of each recipe, as well as the nutritional value of the entire
<code>MealPlan</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 'find' function adapted from AB3. In the DukeCooks Meal Plan, it serves to find all <code>MealPlan</code> whose <code>MealPlanName</code>
contains the user specified keyword(s). This is then adapted to create a <code>findMealPlanWith</code> command, which instead searches
through all the <code>RecipeName</code> stored within the <code>MealPlan</code> to allow the user to search for any <code>MealPlan</code> containing a
<code>RecipeName</code> of a <code>Recipe</code> the user wishes to look for.</p>

Allows for a better user experience, less reliance on the user to ensure that all displayed information is updated.</p>

Harder to implement, requires for checks on meal plans upon every recipe modification, reducing performance of modification operations.</p>
<p class="tableblock"><strong>Our Choice</strong><br>
We chose to have the updating of the recipes within meal plans to be done whenever a relevant recipe operation occurs,
namely recipe deletion and edition. This provides a better user experience as the user will never need to remember that
they have to run an update every single time they modify their recipes. This is favourable as we wish for DukeCooks to
be as easy to use as possible.</p></td>

Relies on user to remember they need to update the meal plans upon recipe modification. Could result in confusion on the
